                <h1>Impact of Technology In Daily Life</h1>
                <p>Technology is something that continually grows and evolves. Society and technology are not two
                    separate
                    things, as they grow alongside each other. That means large portions of everyday life are being
                    affected
                    by the constant stream of innovation and advancement in technology, which in turn allows us to have
                    an
                    even better life. Over the years, technology has revolutionized our world and daily lives.
                    Technology
                    has created amazing tools and resources, putting useful information at our fingertips. Modern
                    technology
                    has paved the way for multi-functional devices like the smartwatch and the smartphone. Computers are
                    increasingly faster, more portable, and higher-powered than ever before. With all of these
                    revolutions,
                    technology has also made our lives easier, faster, better, and more fun. Technology affects the way
                    individuals communicate, learn, and think. It helps society and determines how people interact with
                    each
                    other on a daily basis. Technology plays an important role in society today. It has positive and
                    negative effects on the world and it impacts daily lives. We are living in an era where
                    technological
                    advances are common. The internet and cell phones are some examples. However, with technological
                    advances, there’s a downside to it all. <br><br>

                    <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 30px;">Positive
                            Impact</span></strong><br>
                    Technology helps us to strengthen the relationships by keeping in contact with old friends,
                    colleagues, and co-workers, The e-mails offer speedy delivery of messages, they reduce the paper
                    costs, The human uses technology to travel, communicate, learn, do business & live in comfort..
                    Technology enables communication among people, it has helped you to communicate with people all over
                    the world through email, instant messaging, Skype, social media, etc. <span
                        id="dot">....</span><span id="hide-text"> the internet is the biggest
                        advantage of us because people could receive not only valuable information but they could also
                        work
                        as a freelancer or share their experience. Technology is very useful for the students, They can
                        take
                        the courses and attain their degree online just as any student on campus as the technology
                        offers
                        many chances to the students all over the world to receive an education online. Also Technology
                        has
                        had a huge impact on the healthcare industry. Advancements in diagnostic tools permit doctors to
                        identify health problems early, improving the odds of successful life-saving treatments.
                        Vaccines
                        have been incredibly effective, practically eradicating diseases such as measles, diphtheria,
                        and
                        smallpox – which once caused massive epidemics. Technology has vastly increased productivity,
                        since
                        the ability of computers to solve complex mathematical equations has allowed them to speed up
                        practically every task. <br><br>

                        <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: 30px;">Negative
                                Impact</span></strong> <br>
                        When we use much technology, we will not have enough time to use our imagination or to read and
                        think deeply about the material, we find the information but we may not remember it, we might
                        have
                        difficulty to develop social skills and emotional reactions. Technology can lead to social
                        isolation
                        which is characterized by a lack of contact with other people in normal daily living such as the
                        workplace, with friends & in social activities, Technology can cause the tendonitis in the thumb
                        which is a form of repetitive strain injury caused by the frequent use of thumbs to press
                        buttons on
                        mobile devices or playing too many video games. Technology causes a lack of privacy, where
                        anyone
                        can with a few flicks on the keyboard find anyone’s address and contact information, So, Anyone
                        can
                        use phishing, viruses and hacking that helps to find any information of his/her wish to obtain,
                        anyone can obtain the location on Google Map and someone can know the life story of our on
                        Facebook.
                        The electronic wastes add a high level of toxicity in our air & land because they are not
                        disposed
                        properly, the electronics cause deadly chemicals to the ground, and they are emitting toxic
                        fumes
                        into the air, Technology causes lack of empathy, The constant stream of violent scenes on the
                        video
                        games, TV, movies and YouTube causes people to become desensitized to destruction of any kind.
                        Technology effects on our body, it causes neck and head pain when you look down the devices, It
                        causes blurred vision and migraines, eyestrain can also cause the headaches, it causes an extra
                        layer of stress which was not found before the overuse of technology.</span>
